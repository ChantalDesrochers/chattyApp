Chatty App
=====================

Chatty is a single page instant messaging app built using React, Express, Websockets and SASS.

### Usage

This app allows users to send messages to others online, either anonymously or using a chosen username. Users can update their username at any point and all users will be notified. Users are notified when new users join or leave the chat via a message in the navbar.
Clone the boilerplate and create your own git repo.
